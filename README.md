## Chat

The first thing an user has to do is defining a username which you are called with through the entire game.
After you logged in with the username, automatically join the lobby where players wait others before join a game, and can enjoy their conversations through a chat system. In the lobby, players can choose to create a your own game or join an existing one from sidebar.
A game is a room where players wait it would start with chat. Players can always back to the lobby and join another game.
If you created a your own game, will become an owner who can start the game when the number of players is more than 2.
If you left the game you created, that means the game was closed and other players would forced to laeve and back to the lobby.
